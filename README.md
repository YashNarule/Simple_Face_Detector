# Simple_Face_Detector

This Python code uses the OpenCV library to create a real-time face detection system using a webcam feed. It loads a pre-trained model for detecting frontal faces using the Haar Cascade algorithm. The code continuously captures frames from the webcam, converts them to grayscale, and then applies the face detection algorithm. When a face is detected, it draws a colored rectangle around each face on the live video feed. The program runs until the user presses the 'Q' or 'q' key, at which point it releases the webcam and exits. This code is a simple demonstration of how to build a real-time face detection system using OpenCV.
